### I'm leaving Github ðŸ˜’

There's a plethora of reasons from destroying [your freedom](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/do-githubs-updated-terms-of-service-conflict-with-copyleft) to [forcing Google's Webcomponents](https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?p=202146#p202146),
it's time to leave Microsoft's Github. You can find my UXP repositories on [repo.palemoon.org](https://repo.palemoon.org/explore/repos) and [hyperbola.info](https://git.hyperbola.info:50100/).
